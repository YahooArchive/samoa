# including setting up Storm configuration file (~/.storm/storm.yaml) with correct settings

# samoa.samza.mode corresponds to the execution mode of the Task in Storm 
# possible values:
#   1. yarn: the Task will be sent into nimbus. The nimbus is configured by Storm configuration file
#   2. local: the Task will be sent using local Storm cluster

yarn.container.memory=1024

# max.pi.per.container : maximum number of processing item instances allocated
# to a worker container
# e.g.: if this valua is 2 and there is a ProcessingItem with parallelism of 5.
# The 5 instances of that ProcessingItem will be running on 3 containers (2, 2, and 1)
